# Circular Membrane and Plate Vibration – Musical Acoustics HW2

This project presents a numerical simulation of a vibrating circular membrane and a thin circular plate excited by an impulse. It also analyzes the coupling effect with a vibrating string, as part of the *Musical Acoustics* course at Politecnico di Milano.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Modal analysis of circular membrane (first 18 modes)
- Deformation profiles and mode shapes
- Mass, stiffness, and damping calculations
- Impulse response via frequency and time-domain modeling
- Propagation speeds of different wave types
- Coupling between string and circular plate (hybrid modes)

## 🛠 Technologies
- MATLAB
- Numerical integration
- Bessel functions
- Fourier and convolution analysis

## 📁 Files
- `MA_HW2.pdf` – Full report (theory, equations, plots, discussion)
- `ma_hw2.m` – MATLAB code for all simulations
